It’s not just a place with a great culture, but is also seeing crazy growth right now:\\n- We 5x’d our ARR last year, and are on track for a much higher multiple this year.\\n- Every week, 100k+ new users try out n8n.\\n- We have a fanatic community that absolutely loves the product.<p>We&#x27;re right at the center of defining how people will build with AI in the coming years. But to truly lead this very competitive space, we need someone to tackle the massive challenge of define n8n&#x27;s core AI strategy and execute the roadmap that makes us the undisputed default tool for AI building. That&#x27;s where you come in.<p>What we’re looking for (the unicorn)\\n- Great PM skills: You thrive in high-pace, high-uncertainty environments, can prioritize the most important things from a long list and ruthlessely focus on what’s important. You should also be technical and able to empathise with our technical user base.\\n- AI Native: You bring a deep, nuanced understanding of the modern AI landscape, are well connected in the AI space (part of the &quot;inner circle,&quot; know the key players&#x2F;research) and have informed opinions on where the market’s heading\\n- Humble &amp; passionate: You bring a deep passion for product craft and making an impact. You’re humble, authentic, radically transparent but yet have strong convictions and can stand your ground.<p>Important: We only hire in Europe timezones, so you either need to live here or be willing to relocate.<p>We know this is a rare combination and a demanding role with incredibly high expectations. You&#x27;ll be shaping the future of AI development for potentially millions of users. If you read this and thought &quot;holy crap, that&#x27;s exactly me,&quot; or you know the perfect person, we want to talk. Just ping me via email.',\n",

Yet intervening at these trigger points isn’t just how we stop rising demand; it’s how we create more health and happiness.

Whether you&#x27;re deep in technical details or connecting ideas across disciplines, clear communication is essential.<p>- We value the expertise you bring, but when new information comes along, we also need you to adapt quickly, challenge old assumptions, and embrace new ideas.<p>- If you thrive in an environment that rewards bold ideas, continuous learning, and active engagement in every aspect of the business and want to help people become more agentic, Lore might be the perfect place for you.<p>Open Roles:<p>+ Staff Machine Learning Engineer - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;1</a><p>+ Staff Data Engineer - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;2</a><p>+ Staff SWE (Automation) - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;7</a><p>+ Staff Data Ops - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co&#x2F;roles&#x2F;8</a>',\n",

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or DevOps.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p><pre><code>    * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (70+ currently).\\n    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.\\n    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.\\n    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.\\n</code></pre>\\nWe do have a small cloud footprint, but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. That sounds a bit pretentious and it’s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.<p>A recent example of what I personally find fascinating: last March, Ethereum’s Holesky testnet experienced loss of liveness. This is a real-world, globally distributed system that implements Byzantine fault tolerance, with multiple independent implementations of the protocol. Several of these implementations had a bug in an update, which caused a split in the network. The protocol is designed to handle this situation in theory, but in practice it is triggering previously unexplored failure modes in the implementations, that are hard to test for in synthetic small-scale tests. I think there are very few places where you get to be involved in a planet-scale distributed system exhibiting “interesting” behavior, especially one that is not in control of a single entity. Of course, there is also the less fun part that the testnet was broken, alerts are firing, and it was hard and chaotic to coordinate a fix when the network is not controlled by a single entity. Fortunately it’s a testnet.<p>We’re looking for platforms engineers and software engineers to help build the automation, but also to dive into the node software of the blockchains we validate and see if there are opportunities for us to outperform the rest of the network; Rust experience is valuable there.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.chorus.one&#x2F;o&#x2F;platforms-engineer-remote\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.chorus.one&#x2F;o&#x2F;platforms-engineer-remote</a>.

We&#x27;re growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We&#x27;re obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You&#x27;ll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript&#x2F;TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you&#x27;ll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we&#x27;ve built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We&#x27;ve implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you&#x27;ll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you&#x27;ll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.<p>We&#x27;re hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren&#x27;t singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you&#x27;ll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you&#x27;ll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or DevOps.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p><pre><code>    * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (70+ currently).\\n    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.\\n    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.\\n    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.\\n</code></pre>\\nWe do have a small cloud footprint, but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. That sounds a bit pretentious and it’s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.<p>A recent example of what I personally find fascinating: last March, Ethereum’s Holesky testnet experienced loss of liveness. This is a real-world, globally distributed system that implements Byzantine fault tolerance, with multiple independent implementations of the protocol. Several of these implementations had a bug in an update, which caused a split in the network. The protocol is designed to handle this situation in theory, but in practice it is triggering previously unexplored failure modes in the implementations, that are hard to test for in synthetic small-scale tests. I think there are very few places where you get to be involved in a planet-scale distributed system exhibiting “interesting” behavior, especially one that is not in control of a single entity. Of course, there is also the less fun part that the testnet was broken, alerts are firing, and it was hard and chaotic to coordinate a fix when the network is not controlled by a single entity. Fortunately it’s a testnet.<p>We’re looking for platforms engineers and software engineers to help build the automation, but also to dive into the node software of the blockchains we validate and see if there are opportunities for us to outperform the rest of the network; Rust experience is valuable there.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.chorus.one&#x2F;o&#x2F;platforms-engineer-remote\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.chorus.one&#x2F;o&#x2F;platforms-engineer-remote</a>.

We&#x27;re growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We&#x27;re obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You&#x27;ll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript&#x2F;TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you&#x27;ll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups.

Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position.

Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you&#x27;ll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you&#x27;ll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team.<p>We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter.
